# Random User Scripts
A collection of random user scripts I've created or adapted for whatever reason.

## Requirements

Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, or your chosen script manager extension for your web browser. Enable 'developer mode' or 'custom script usage' in your web browser add-on settings where required.

## List of Scripts

 - Patreon Widescreen - Created due to the fact that Patreon make all their videos small by default for some reason, this stretches the container to fill the width of the screen automatically

## Disclaimer

These scripts are all unofficial and created or adapted by me (phyco1991). They are not supported by the relevant website owners in any way, and is subject to breaking if they change their API or website(s) in future.
